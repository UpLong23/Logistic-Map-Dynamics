1) Utilize the precision spin-box to specify custom precision. The intentional restriction on typing aims to prevent inadvertent entries inconsistent with the default precision of JavaScript's floating-point numbers.

2) Use the parameter value and initial value sliders to select the parameters and points of interest to study their orbits. This can be achieved through sliding or manual input. Additionally, clicking on the slider's current position allows for fine adjustments using the left and right arrows on your keyboard, allowing the examination of minute differences of order 10^(-precision).

3) Please be aware that Plotly offers various additional functionalities, incuding zooming, panning, and the ability to capture snapshots of each plot.
